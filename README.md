# Deep Learning Foundations

This repository documents my structured journey into Deep Learning, starting from first principles and progressing toward modern architectures.

The focus of this repository is **conceptual clarity, from-scratch understanding, and clean implementation** — not copy-pasted solutions or shortcut-based learning.

## Learning Philosophy

- Strong emphasis on fundamentals  
- Explain concepts before writing code  
- One concept, one clean implementation  
- Minimal reliance on high-level abstractions early on  
- Focus on understanding over speed  

This repository intentionally avoids “vibe coding” and treats Deep Learning as an engineering discipline rather than a black box.

## Learning Source

- **100 Days of Deep Learning — CampusX**

The playlist is used as a structured guide, with independent reasoning, notes, and implementations added on top.

---

## Topics Covered (and Planned)

- Perceptrons and decision boundaries  
- Artificial Neural Networks (ANNs)  
- Activation functions and loss intuition  
- Training concepts and optimization  
- Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs)  
- Sequence models (RNNs, LSTMs)  
- Attention and Transformers  

---

## How to Navigate This Repository

- Start with `notes/` for conceptual understanding  
- Refer to `notebooks/` for practical implementations  
- Follow the commit history to track day-by-day progress  

Each notebook and note reflects active learning rather than polished final projects.

## Long-Term Objective

To develop a strong, explainable understanding of Deep Learning systems and later extend this knowledge toward:
- Real-world ML/DL applications  
- Agentic AI systems  
- Research-oriented projects  

---

## Status

In progress.  
Built incrementally, one concept at a time.
