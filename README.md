#  Deep Learning Foundations

> A structured, from-scratch journey into Deep Learning — focused on understanding, not vibe coding.

This repository documents my progression through deep learning fundamentals, starting from perceptrons and neural networks, and gradually moving toward modern deep learning architectures.

The goal of this repo is **depth over speed** — building strong intuition, clean implementations, and clear explanations.

## 📘 Learning Philosophy

- 🔍 **Strong fundamentals first**
- ✍️ **Explain before coding**
- 🧠 **From-scratch understanding**
- 🚫 **No vibe coding**
- 📈 **Daily incremental progress**

Every concept implemented here is backed by clear reasoning and reflection.
