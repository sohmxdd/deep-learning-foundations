#  Deep Learning Foundations

> A structured, from-scratch journey into Deep Learning — focused on understanding, not vibe coding.

This repository documents my progression through deep learning fundamentals, starting from perceptrons and neural networks, and gradually moving toward modern deep learning architectures.

The goal of this repo is **depth over speed** — building strong intuition, clean implementations, and clear explanations.

## Current Focus

At the moment, this repository focuses on building strong deep learning fundamentals
through hands-on experiments and clear conceptual understanding.

Current areas of work:
- Implementing neural networks from scratch and using Keras/TensorFlow
- Understanding training dynamics, overfitting, and evaluation metrics
- Building clean, reproducible experiments (e.g., customer churn prediction using ANN)
- Strengthening intuition behind preprocessing, scaling, and model design choices

The goal is not just to build models, but to deeply understand *why* each step is required.

## 📘 Learning Philosophy

- 🔍 **Strong fundamentals first**
- ✍️ **Explain before coding**
- 🧠 **From-scratch understanding**
- 🚫 **No vibe coding**
- 📈 **Daily incremental progress**

Every concept implemented here is backed by clear reasoning and reflection.
