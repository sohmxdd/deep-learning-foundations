# Loss Functions

Loss functions define the objective a machine learning or deep learning model
optimizes during training. They quantify the error between predictions and
ground truth values.

Choosing the correct loss function is critical, as it directly affects
learning behavior, convergence speed, and final model performance.

## Why Loss Functions Matter

- They guide gradient-based optimization
- They define what the model considers “good” or “bad” predictions
- An inappropriate loss can prevent learning entirely
