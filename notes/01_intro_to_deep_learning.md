# Introduction to Deep Learning

Deep Learning is a subset of Machine Learning that uses neural networks
with multiple layers to automatically learn features from data.

Key idea:
Neural networks are composed of neurons arranged in layers.

## Why Deep Learning is Needed

Traditional Machine Learning models rely heavily on manual feature engineering.
For complex data such as images, text, and audio, designing features by hand
becomes extremely difficult.

Deep Learning solves this by allowing models to automatically learn features
at multiple levels of abstraction.

Example:
- In image data, early layers learn edges
- Middle layers learn shapes
- Deeper layers learn objects

This hierarchical feature learning is the core strength of Deep Learning.
